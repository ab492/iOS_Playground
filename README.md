# iOS/Swift Playground

This is my playground for working through Swift challenges and ideas. Some of the challenges are inspired by gaps I've noticed in my knowledge, while others have been set by ChatGPT to push my understanding further.

## Challenges
- [Implement a Cache with Time-to-Live (TTL) using Property Wrappers](TimeToLiveCache/README.md)
- [Decode some tricky nested JSON](DecodingTrickyJson/README.md)
