# iOS/Swift Playground

This is my playground for working through Swift challenges and ideas. These are inspired by gaps in my knowledge or to push my understanding further.

## Test Driven Development Challenges
- [Implement a Cache with Time-to-Live (TTL) using Property Wrappers](TimeToLiveCache/README.md)
- [Implement a password validator](PasswordValidator/README.md)
- [Decode some tricky nested JSON](DecodingTrickyJson/README.md)

## Work in Progress
- [SearchViewModel debouncer using TDD](SearchViewModel)
- [Swift implementation of the xUnit Test Pattern](SwiftXUnit)
